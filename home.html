            <center><h2>OUR MISSION</h2></center>
            <p>Animals should have the right to live freely, without being killed or exploited by humans. We will fight until this happens!</p>
            <p><b>Now i am going to introduce you with some terms that you should be aware of.</b></p>
            <h2><b>INVASIC SPECIES:</b></h2>
            <p>An invasive species is an organism that causes ecological or economic harm in a new environment where it is not native. ... Invasive species are capable of causing extinctions of native plants and animals, reducing biodiversity, competing with native organisms for limited resources, and altering habitats. In case,if you saw that specie(animal) you have to either kill it or make him your pet. That's according to the rules.</p>
            <p><b>INVASIC SPECIES IN PAKISTAN:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Broussonetia papyrifera</li>
                    <li>Prosopis juliflora</li>
                    <li>Eichhornia crassipes</li>
                    <li>Salvinia molesta</li>
                    <li>Parthenium hystrophorus</li>
                    <li>Lantana camara</li>
                </ul>
            <h2><b>EXTINCT SPECIES:</b></h2>
            <p>Extinction of a particular animal or plant species occurs when there are no more individuals of that species alive anywhere in the world - the species has died out. This is a natural part of evolution. That's may occur due to human interferance such as; destruction of habibt, pollution, illegal hunting.</p>
            <p><b>EXTINCT SPECIES IN PAKISTAN:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>tiger (Panthera tigris)</li>
                    <li> swamp deer (Cervus duvauceli)</li>

                    <li>Indian one-horned Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis)</li>
                </ul>
            <h2><b>ENDANGERED SPECIES:</b></h2>
            <p>A species considered to be facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild. This result in extinction of species. The reason is very similar to that of extinct species.</p>
            <p>WWF(World Wide Fund for nature) doing their best but these animals are brutally kill by us. We are assamed of us. They need our help to save these animals. I am big lover of animals. But,i am sure that, you are also lover. Illegal killing of animal result in distrubance in food chain. That's, why every year we are facing the attack of locusts. They are distroying our feild. This is beacuse that their natural hunter are no more now. They are extinct now. That's a serious issue we are facing today.</p>
